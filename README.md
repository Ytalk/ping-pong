It uses JavaFX and JFoenix libraries, in addition to the Spring Boot framework. The game must contain local mode, and online with a room system hosted on a website. Varied game mechanics/modes and match customization.


- It is “Control 1” that starts playing the match, and when a player scores, the opponent will have control of the ball. Once the objective score is reached, a pop-up will inform you who won, and when you click “OK” you are redirected to the menu.
