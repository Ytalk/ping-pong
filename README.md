- Demo with PvP: It is ‚ÄúControl 1‚Äù that starts playing the match, and when a player scores, the opponent will have control of the ball. Once the objective score is reached, a pop-up will inform you who won, and when you click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù you are redirected to the menu.

- Demo against bot: Depending on the direction the racket is going when it collides with the ball this will affect the Y axis of the ball.
